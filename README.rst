BioImage Archive REMBI models
=============================

Models and tools for working with the BioImage Archive's REMBI (Recommended Metadata for Biological Images) implementation.

These are works in progress, if you're interested in making use of the models, please get in touch at bioimage-archive@ebi.ac.uk to make sure we can let you know as they evolve.
